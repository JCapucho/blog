Let's try this again, so last time I wrote something here was over a year ago.
During that time I became annoyed with the amount of maintenance the blog
required and the absurd number of vulnerabilities github sent me emails about,
so I decided to start using a static site generator.

I've settled with [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] because of all the options
considered, It was the only one who had all the things I needed,
[[orgmode.org][org-mode]] (Since the last post I switched from vscode to emacs
and I'm loving it) and fast iteration times.

And I think it looks pretty good I ended up using the awesome
[[https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/][PaperMod]], theme so now the
color scheme shouldn't look like something from a decade ago and there's both a
dark and light mode and I also finally added comments (They are backed by
Github Issues using the fantastic
[[https://github.com/utterance/utterances][utterances]] package).

I don't know how frequently I'll update the blog, I've been mostly working on
the glsl frontend of [[https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga/][naga]] (for those who
don't know naga is a shader translator that aims to replace spirv-cross in the
[[https://github.com/gfx-rs][gfx]] project), maybe I'll write a simple guide on
how to use it or about some of the more technical aspects of the implementation.

But for now I wish the person reading this a good day and I hope to see you
next time the blog is updated (probably next year, relevant
[[https://xkcd.com/605][xhcd]]).
